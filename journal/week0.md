### Use CloudShell
On AWS page I was able to find the cloud CLI link and clicked on it. Using the tip from Andrew Brown's video I was able to use the code below to active the auto prompts to help with auto completing the commands.

```
aws --cli-auto-prompt

```

### Installed AWS CLI
Using the gitpod button I launched gitpod cloud development platform. It launched on vscode. Using the vscode terminal I installed the AWS CLI using the commands below
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
